DESCRIPTION ABOUT THE DApp:

The MEDICARE Decentraised Application(DApp) manages the hospital, doctor and patient registrations, their ratings and the patient record managements correspondingly on Ethereum Blockchain platform. The patient registration is in such a way that the patient can create a record for him/herself and consult any doctor in any hospital so that each doctor consulting the particular patient can see his/her medical history record.

In this DApp, the Government Organisation(HOII - Hospital Organisation in India) registers the hospitals with their corresponding public keys which give access for the hospitals to register their respective doctors and manage their hospital records. The Organisation client can add and delete the hospital details and likewise, the permissioned hospitals can add and delete the details of the doctors in their corresponding hospital. In both the cases, a record of rating track is kept for each hospital and each doctor.

The patient registration is done in such a way that the patient can create a record for him/herself and consult any doctor in any hospital so that each doctor consulting the particular patient can see his/her medical history record and the consulting doctor can add reports to the patient's record. The patient can finally do the rating for each consultation they have done.
